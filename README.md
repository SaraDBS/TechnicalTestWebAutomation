**End to End happy path scenario of a customer flow through the store.**
**My first time using python3 and robot framework, enjoyed the experience very much.
**Ideally I should not have hardcoded registered username and password.**
**If given more time would have covered a lot more scenarios e.g:**
```
Buying several products
Negative scenarios such as searching for invalid products, 
invalid information in registration form
invalid payment information
Registration validation
Forgot your password flow
```
